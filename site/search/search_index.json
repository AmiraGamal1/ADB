When an application (the client) needs to perform operations such as creating databases, running queries, or retrieving data, it establishes a connection to communicate with the server. The port is a communication endpoint on your machine. By default, MySQL uses port <code>3306</code> to listen for incoming client requests. In short, a connection is essential to allow your client tools or applications to interact with the MySQL server, run queries, manage data, and exchange information.</p>"},{"location":"Labs/Lab0/#python-programming-language","title":"Python programming language","text":"<p>We will use the Python programming language to simulate the following:     * Concurrency control algorithms     * Database recovery techniques</p>"},{"location":"Labs/Lab0/#download-and-install-python","title":"Download and Install Python","text":"<ol> <li>Go to the Python official website</li> <li>Download the latest stable version</li> <li>Open the installer and check <ul> <li>Add Python to PATH</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Labs/Lab0/#download-and-install-vs-code","title":"Download and Install VS Code","text":"<ol> <li>Visit the website VS code Click on <code>Windows</code> to download VS code for Windows, as shown below </li> <li>After the download finished open the <code>VSCodeUserSetup</code> executable file, when it open select <code>I accept the agreement</code> then click on <code>Next</code> </li> <li>Select all the option as seen below </li> <li>Finally we are ready to install the VS code, click on <code>install</code> and wait untail the setup finish</li> <li>On the Vs code, on the left-hand side, click on <code>extension</code> then in the search bar, write <code>Python</code> select <code>Python microsoft</code> and click on <code>Install</code> as shown below </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Labs/Lab0/#alteranative-way-to-practice","title":"Alteranative way to practice:","text":"<pre><code>* Online Postgred server **[supabase](https://supabase.com/)**\n* Online Python Editer **[programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)**\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Labs/Lab0/#assignment-install-mysql-create-a-database-and-query-it","title":"Assignment: Install MySQL, Create a Database, and Query It","text":"<p>Due Date on 24/5/2025</p> <p> See the requirement about the structures of the lab here</p> <ol> <li>Download and Install MySQL</li> <li>Connect to the server</li> <li>Create a New Database</li> <li>Create a Table</li> <li>Insert Data</li> <li>Query the Data     <pre><code>USE DatabaseName;\nSELECT * FROM TableName;\n</code></pre></li> </ol>"},{"location":"Labs/Lab0/#what-to-assign","title":"What to assign:","text":"<p>Take Screenshots:</p> <ol> <li>SQL code (on MySQL)</li> <li>The output of your query</li> <li>Put it all on one document</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Labs/general_instructions/","title":"General Instructions","text":""},{"location":"Labs/general_instructions/#please-follow-these-instructions-carefully","title":"Please follow these instructions carefully:","text":""},{"location":"Labs/general_instructions/#file-submission","title":"File Submission","text":"<ul> <li>Submit your assignment as a single PDF file.</li> <li>The PDF must include all required screenshots (code and output).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Labs/general_instructions/#screenshot-annotations","title":"Screenshot Annotations","text":"<p>On every screenshot containing SQL script, add a comment at the top with the following information:</p> <ol> <li>Student Name</li> <li>Department</li> <li>Student Index Number</li> </ol> <pre><code>    -- Name: student name\n    -- Department: Computer Science, ...\n    -- Index: 01x-xxx\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Labs/general_instructions/#lab-title","title":"Lab Title","text":"<p>Write the lab title as \"Lab 0, Lab 1, ...\" clearly at the top of your PDF.</p>"},{"location":"Labs/general_instructions/#deadline","title":"Deadline","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Submissions must be uploaded before the deadline.</p> </li> <li> <p>Late submissions may be penalised according to the situations.</p> </li> </ol>"}]}
